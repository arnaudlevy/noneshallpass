# None shall pass

The purpose of the extension is to remove undesired websites from search queries.
It's a Proof Of Concept (POC) with a major e-commerce provider.
The blocking occurs only when the browser native search bar is used, not when you use a search engine in a window.

## Roadmap

- provide an option page letting users choose which sites to block
- become compatible with other search engines
- let the user disable the blocking on icon click
